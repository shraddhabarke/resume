\section{Research Agenda}

\cvline{}{My research focuses on building human-like AI systems that aim to automate scientific discovery and learn causal theories of the world. To that end, I draw on ideas from program synthesis to develop systems that generalize well, require less data and produce interpretable results. Further, my research also investigates how powerful AI large language models have changed the landscape of programming through the lens of human computer interaction and privacy. Keywords: Program Synthesis and Verification, Artificial Intelligence, Human Computer Interaction.}{}
